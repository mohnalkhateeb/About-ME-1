                <p>This project presents a technique to detect the location of the different faults on a transmission lines
                    for quick an d reliable operation of protection schemes. The simulation is developed in MATLAB to
                    generate the fundamental component of the transient voltage and current. MATLAB software is used
                    to simulate different operating and fault conditions on high voltage transmission line, namely single
                    phase to ground fault, line to line fault, double line to ground and three phase short circuit. Effects of
                    variations in the fault resistance (Rf), distance to fault (Lf) have been studied broadly on the voltage,
                    current an d its relation to impedance of the system which creates the logic for detection,
                    classification and location of faults.</p>
